# Functional Playground

Exploring typed functional programming with the TypeScript library [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts)

Each 'playground' will feature a code snippet, example, basic implementation etc elucidating some functional programming concept.

1. Making async requests using the TaskEither monad. Multiple async requests and collecting the results with traversals. Using the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/) for data.
2. Password validation using Applicatives and SemiGroups
3. A basic paginator
4. --
5. --
6. Using SequenceT to apply actions of different types on same 
7. Interacting with the canvas, working with effectful IO as a type class (ReaderIO)

Also see [this](https://github.com/mkessy/functional-pokemon) repository where I'm going to build out a basic React App that implements many FP concepts in a more practical environment.
